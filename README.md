The `@japa/run-failed-tests` plugin runs only the failed tests on subsequent runs.

Here's how it works under the hood.

- You ran the tests suite, and a couple of tests failed.
- On the next run, only the failed test will run.
- If all tests are green, the next run will execute all the tests.

```sh
npm i @japa/run-failed-tests 
```

```ts
import { runFailedTests } from '@japa/run-failed-tests'

configure({
  plugins: [runFailedTests()]
})
```
